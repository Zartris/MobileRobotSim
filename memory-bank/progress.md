## Known Issues

As the project is in the initial setup phase, there are no specific implementation issues to report yet. Potential challenges that we anticipate include:

1. Balancing flexibility and performance in the core interfaces
2. Efficient state serialization without excessive copying
3. Managing dependencies in the containerized environment
4. Clear separation between simulation logic and visualization
