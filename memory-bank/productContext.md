# MobileRobotSim Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
MobileRobotSim addresses the need for a lightweight, flexible simulation environment specifically designed for studying mobile robot interactions, particularly in merge scenarios. While there are existing robotic simulation platforms, many are overly complex, require significant setup, or lack the specific focus on merge behaviors that this project prioritizes.

## Problems It Solves

### Development and Testing Challenges
- Provides a controlled environment for testing robot merging algorithms without physical hardware
- Reduces development costs and accelerates iteration cycles for algorithm development
- Enables reproducible testing scenarios for consistent evaluation

### Research Applications
- Facilitates research into efficient merging strategies for autonomous mobile robots
- Allows for systematic study of different robot behaviors in merge scenarios
- Supports data collection for machine learning applications in robot navigation

### Educational Value
- Offers a clean, understandable platform for teaching robot kinematics
- Demonstrates software engineering best practices in simulation development
- Provides a foundation for students to experiment with robot control algorithms

## How It Should Work

### Core Workflow
1. **Configuration**: Users define an environment with lanes, merge points, and obstacles
2. **Robot Setup**: Users create and position robots with specific properties
3. **Simulation**: The engine advances time, updating robot states based on their control algorithms
4. **Analysis**: Users can visualize, save, or analyze the simulation results
5. **Iteration**: The system state can be saved and loaded for debugging or scenario exploration

### Technical Operation
- Simulation operates in discrete time steps
- Each robot updates its state based on its control algorithm and environmental awareness
- The environment maintains the state of static elements and handles collision detection
- The system state captures the complete state of all entities at each time step
- Visualization is decoupled from simulation logic

## User Experience Goals

### For Researchers
- Rapid prototyping of merge algorithms
- Clear visualization of robot interactions
- Easy data collection for analysis
- Reproducible experiments

### For Developers
- Clean, well-documented API
- Extensible architecture for adding new robot types
- Straightforward integration of custom control algorithms
- Efficient debugging through state saving/loading

### For Educators
- Simple examples that demonstrate core robotics concepts
- Visual representation of robot kinematics
- Scaffolded complexity for introducing advanced topics

## Key Differentiators
- **Focus**: Specialized for merge scenarios rather than general robotics
- **Simplicity**: Lightweight design without unnecessary complexity
- **Extensibility**: Modular architecture for easy extension
- **Portability**: Containerized environment for consistent operation across platforms
- **State Management**: First-class support for saving and loading system state
