# MobileRobotSim Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are currently in the **project initialization phase**. Our immediate focus is on:

1. Setting up the project structure and development environment
2. Defining the core interfaces and class hierarchies
3. Implementing the basic simulation engine and point robot functionality
4. Creating a containerized development environment with VSCode integration

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial project setup, there are no previous changes to reference. The project is starting with:

- Basic project documentation in README.md
- Initial .gitignore configuration
- Memory bank documentation for project context

## Active Development Threads

### Core Architecture Implementation
- Define and implement core interfaces (MobileRobotBase, Environment, etc.)
- Create base simulation engine with time management
- Implement system state representation and management
- Establish serialization framework

### Environment Setup
- Docker containerization with C++17 toolchain
- VSCode integration with development container
- CMake build configuration
- External dependency management (Eigen)
- Enhanced code intelligence with clangd
- Code style enforcement with clang-format

### Point Robot Implementation
- Basic kinematics model
- State management
- Integration with simulation engine

## Current Decisions and Considerations

### Design Decisions
- **State Management Approach**: Every component will implement getState() and loadState() methods for consistent serialization
- **Component Ownership**: SimulationEngine owns robots and environment objects
- **Observer Pattern**: Used for visualization and event handling
- **Eigen Integration**: Primary numeric/geometric computation library
- **Development Environment**: 
  - Using clangd for improved code intelligence
  - Disabling overlapping MS C++ extension features when using clangd
  - Consistent code formatting with .clang-format 
  - Code quality checking with clang-tidy

### Open Questions
- Specific serialization format (JSON vs binary vs custom)
- Visualization technology selection (OpenGL vs SDL vs headless only initially)
- Test framework selection (Catch2 vs Google Test)
- Collision detection granularity and performance considerations

### Technical Challenges
- Efficient state updates without excessive memory allocation
- Clear ownership semantics for simulation objects
- Extensibility without compromising performance
- Balancing flexibility with simplicity in the robot interfaces

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Create project directory structure
2. ✅ Implement Docker/devcontainer configuration
3. ✅ Set up CMake build system
4. ✅ Define and implement core interfaces
5. ✅ Create simple point robot implementation
6. ✅ Implement basic simulation engine
7. ✅ Add serialization support
8. ✅ Configure development environment with clangd integration
9. Generate documentation for major components
10. Implement simple example scenarios

### Short-term Goals
1. Complete a minimal working simulation with point robots
2. Implement basic merge scenario environment
3. Add simple visualization capability
4. Establish testing framework
5. Document API and usage examples

### Medium-term Goals
1. Add more sophisticated robot types
2. Implement quadtree for spatial queries
3. Enhance visualization capabilities
4. Create sample merge scenarios
5. Optimize performance for larger robot counts
